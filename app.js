    'In my game the player navigates through a maze, picking up powerups along the way. I used jQuery to speed up the development, allowing me to concentrate on my game logic, adding features, and styling within the tight deadline.',

    'CRAVE satisfies your cravings on an A to B route by displaying restaurants, within a set radius, that cater to your particular mood. As we had a tight deadline we worked under an agile methodology. During morning stand ups we would show what we had been working on to ensure we all knew how the app worked. I focused mainly on the AngularJS 1 front end, and Iâ€™m particularly proud of the discreet animated navigation menu that I implemented.',
    'For my final project I decided to focus on a mobile first experience, delivering a competitive todo list for different content. I used React on the front end and Node.js on the back end. I integrated the Spotify and TMDB APIs on the back end, to fetch and display relevant imagery and metadata to the user. Insomnia was helpful for checking API calls, and testing was an effective way of ensuring the efficacy of my requests. I used Trello so that I would have an accurate impression of how long I was able to spend on tasks and to prioritise them sensibly.'];
